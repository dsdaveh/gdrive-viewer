This repository contains several projects surrounding tools and working examples using the ridiculously useful [tidyverse googledrive](https://github.com/tidyverse/googledrive) package by Jenny Brian and Lucy McGowan:

### [Shiny Link - Viewer for your Google Drive Files](https://dsdaveh.shinyapps.io/GoogleDriveViewer/)
This is an example of a Shiny app that can be useful for seeing file growth over time. In order for authentication to work, you'll need to download it locally and run it (can't run OAuth thru shinyapps.io). I created a snapshot of Drive data for the example, but to produce something truly interesting, I'd have to reveal too much of my Drive account (I used a temporary one for the example).


### [Notebook Link - Example analysis of my personal Drive space](prelim_eda.md)

and [Where do I send the $$ I used to pay Google for storage I didn't need?](reducing_drive_quota.md)
