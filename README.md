This repository contains several projects surrounding tools and working examples using the ridiculously useful [tidyverse googledrive](https://github.com/tidyverse/googledrive) package by Jenny Brian and Lucy McGowan:

## Shiny Viewer for your Google Drive Files  
Slides for presentation
<span style="color:red;">TODO: Link required</span>


## [An analysis of my personal Drive space](prelim_eda.md)

and [Where do I send the $ I used to pay Google for storage I didn't need?](reducing_drive_quota.md)
